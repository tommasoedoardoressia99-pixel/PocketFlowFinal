    pillar: "Robotics",
    title: "Robotics note",

  },
  {
    pillar: "Open Source AI",
    title: "Open-source AI note",
    body: "Open-source AI is not only about free weights. The real leverage is inspection: teams can test, compress, adapt, audit, and understand the tool they depend on.\n\nBuilder takeaway: openness is an engineering advantage when the workflow is disciplined.",

    pillar: "Research Signals",
    title: "Research signal note",

    title: "AI operations note",

    pillar: "Healthcare Admin",

    pillar: "Voice Interfaces",

  },
  {
    pillar: "Small Business AI",
    title: "Small business AI note",

    title: "Multimodal AI note",

  {
    pillar: "Governance",
    title: "AI governance note",

    pillar: "Human-in-the-loop AI",
    title: "Human-in-the-loop note",

  },
  {
    pillar: "AI Interfaces",
    title: "AI interface note",

    pillar: "Workflow Automation",
    title: "Workflow automation note",

    pillar: "Browser Agents",
    title: "Browser agent note",

    pillar: "Design Systems",

    pillar: "Personal AI",
    title: "Personal AI note",
